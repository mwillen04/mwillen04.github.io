      Although the U.S. poulation only has <b> 37% </b> of people of color,
      <b>67%</b> of them are behind bars. (It's Time to Reform the Criminal

    <h2>
      How Did We Get Here?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Dating back to the birth of America, we see the founding fathers creating
      what we call the "Bill of Rights". According to the eigth amendment,
      "cruel & unusual" punishment was not allowed, therefore the idea of
      incarceration took place. People who would be placed in jail would be
      given a Bible and basic neccessities while living in a confined space
      rather than being whipped in public or getting their ears cut off.
      (Foundations of Criminal Justice) While this seems like a good idea, the
      people of color in America were not treated in this manner. Starting in
      the 1800s, some of the earliest police were "slave patrols".

      "I [patroller's name], do swear, that I will as searcher for guns, swords,
      and other weapons among the slaves in my district, faithfully, and as
      privately as I can, discharge the trust reposed in me as the law directs,
      to the best of my power. So help me God." - Slave Patroller's Oath, North
      Carolina, 1828. (Slave Patrols: An Early Form of Policing, Hansen)
    </p>

    />

    <p>
      In short, a slave patroller had to do three things...
    </p>

    <li>chase down slaves, apprehend them, then return them to their owners</li>
    <li>provide a form of terror to deter slave revolts</li>
    <li>
      maintain a form of dicipline for slaves who were subject to summary
      justice (outside of law)
    </li>

    <p>
      (Slave Patrols: An Early Form of Policing, Hansen)
    </p>

    <p>
      This is nothing like the punishment given to those incarcerated as it did
      not give a slave breathing room to "rest" or "read a Bible". They were
      tormented pyschological and physically to work for people who hated them
      and only tolerated them because they were money-makers. A well written
      essay by a student of the University of Arkansas divulged, "Slavery was
      used as a method to undermine blacks to maintain a level of superiority
      and security. The prison system is a bigger scale of the significant
      racialized system. Although slavery has been deemed unconstitutional, our
      current penal system has some disturbingly similar characteristics."
      (Racial Prejudice in the Criminal Justice System, Cooper). America is
      built off of making others work for them, just like their motherland.
      Despite being the "land of the free", it is evident people of color were
      not included in the song "The Star Spangled Banner" when it was first
      made.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even after slavery, people of color, specifically African-Americans have
      continued to face police brutality for decades and unfair treatment in the
      justice system. One example of this is the "Scottboro Boys".
    </p>

    />

    <p>
      In the year of 1932, two white woman accussed nine black boys, ranging
      from ages 12-19 of raping them on a train (All White Juries). These fasely
      accussed boys were retried on trial many times by all-white juries and
      ultimately eight of theboys were sentneced to death for a crime they did
      not commit. The sad truth is this was the fate of many African American
      boys in these times. If they spoke the "wrong way", looked the "wrong
      way", or breathed the "wrong way", they would be convicted of something
      and killed. In a way, it is like that today. African Americans are
      consistantly racially profiled and are forced to assimilate themselves in
      order to not fit a negative stereotype.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Are We Still Being Affected Today?
    </h3>

    <p>
      A young man strolled down an inactive street on August 9th of 2014. People
      waved and smiled when he passed their home. His mind rested, starting to
      ease knowing his mother would have some medicine to relieve her migraine.
      That same day on the news, an unarmed teen named Mike Brown hurled over
      the ground after a police man shot him. The young man, who brought his
      mother medicine, went by the name of Mike Brown. Before he closed his eyes
      for the last time, he cried out, pleading for his life from more than six
      feet away from the officer with his hands in the air. Prior to his death,
      police men sought to find a tall, black man, that was wide in size.
      Unluckily, Mike Brown fitted this same description and due to his “thug
      appearance”, says Officer Wilson, death knocked on his door.
    </p>

    <p>
      In more recent accounts the names of George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, Daniel
      Prude, Breonna Taylor, Atitiana Jefferson, Stephon Clark, Botham Jean,
      Patrick Warren, Vincent Belmote, Angelo Quinto, Anjelo Crooms, Sincere
      Pierce, Jonathan Price, Dreasjon Reed, William Greene, Manuel Elijah
      Ellis, Elijah McClain, etc...I could continue ages on the names of African
      Americans who have faced police brutality within this year and the
      previous years before that, but when will the list stop?
    </p>

    <p>
      The efforts people of all ethnicities that have created to stand up for
      what is right does not go unnoticed. The sweat, blood, and tears they have
      let drip down their body while advocating for equal rights will always be
      remebered. Their marches of faith, of hope, and courage is well respected.
      However, truly, no change to the U.S. judicial system has been made yet.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Why Do We "Need" A Change?
    </h4>

    <p>
      When recalling the issue at hand, people of color are not advocating to be
      free of any type of punishment when conducting crimes, and I believe that
      is where the confusion stems from. Rather, they want to be treated equally
      for the crimes they have committed. There is no reason why a twelve year
      old boy was shot dead in the forehead within two seconds because he was
      playing with a toy gun, but Tamir Rice was. In contrast, it is okay for a
      seventeen-year-old to shoot protestors with a rifle and still live, his
      name is Kyle Rittenhouse. Take a guess at which one was not a person of
      color. Just by guessing that Tamir Rice must be the person of color just
      with the mere coverage of the story, you have proved the criminal justice
      system is racially targeted.
    </p>

    <h5>
      When Can You Help?
    </h5>

    <p>
      Now. To help fight racism and discrimination in the criminal justice
      system, the use of educating people through social media is vital. Due to
      many people being trapped in their homes during the pandemic, it gives
      people time to think, reflect, and take action. The more people that are
      notified about the things going on, the more connections that will be made
      towards helping this issue. America has great potential, however if it
      still repeats its past it will never be able to get to a brighter future.
      It’s time to utilize the technology that is made to better the society.
