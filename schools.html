    <h1>
      School Segregation
    </h1>

    <p>
      Ever since Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954, segregating schools based
      soely on race has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
      Though this is true, school segregation continues to be on the rise today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nearing today, less black students are attending majority-white schools
      than from the '80's and '90's. This boasts implications that schools today
      are becoming more segregated then ever in the times since Brown vs. Board
      of Education. But why?
    </p>

    <p>
      Wealth disparity. As wealth disparity among races increases inside of the
      United States, so does school segregation.

      />
<br> 
      As time passes, the number of high poverty schools with a predominant
      minority population seem to increase while the number of low poverty
      schools with small minority population is decreasing.

      How can we reduce school segregation?

      It is possible for towns to craft boundaries differently- not focusing on
      sending students necessarily to the closest school- to reduce segregation.
      The main catalyst for modern day school segregation is wealth disparity.

      AP Course Participation
    </h3>

<br> 
    <p>
      This chart shows AP course particpation among various ethnic groups. As
      seen on the national level, American Indian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander,
      Black, Asian American, and Multiracial students are disproportionately
      represented the AP cirriculum than their white counterparts.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Standardized Testing

      READING GRADE 8: Average Score 2019 by Ethnicity: <br>

      Black- 244 <br>
      Hispanic- 252 <br> 
      Asian/Pacific Islander- 281 <br> 
      American Indian/Alaska Native-248 <br>

      MATHEMATICS GRADE 8: Average Score 2019 by Ethnicity: <br> 
      White- 292 <br> 
      Black- 260 <br> 
      Hispanic- 268 <br> 
      Asian/Pacific Islander- 310 <br> 
      American Indian/Alaska Native- 262 <br> 
      Two or More Races- 286 <br> 
     <br> 
      As seen by the data derived from the National Assessment of Educational Progress's
      (NAEP)standardized tests, black, hispanic, and indgineous people score
      significantly lower than their white and asian peers. This obviously
      presents a huge problem; the academic achievement gap is at the root of
      racial wealth disparity, segregation within the job market, and school
      segregation.
    </p>

    <h6>
      What is the cause of the academic achievement gap and what can be done to
      reduce it?
    </h6>

    <p>
      Wealth disparity and socioeconomic status are some of the main causes for
      this.

      />
<br> 
      People on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum, which are primarily
      minority populations, have a clear disadvantage right from the start of
      their education, spiraling into the academic achievement gap. Obviously,
      reducing the socioeconomic gap between races would be vital in closing the
      academic achievement gap. There are other way to help too, such as
      increasing the instructional time of struggling schools and students,
      providing a equal and rigorous cirriculum at every single educational
      building in the nation, ensuring noone is left out, hiring a diverse staff
      of teachers that are willing to motivate and engage students of all races
      and ethnicities, holding professional development clinics for educators on
      this particular issue, and providing supplemental instruction to those who
      struggle. While shutting the academic achievement gap is a large feat,
      proper funding of all schools, especially of those in lower income
      communities, will be sure to move the process along.
