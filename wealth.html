    <h2>
      Causes
    </h2>

    <h4>
      Slavery
    </h4>

    <p>
      In 1619, captured Africans were taken from the African West Coast and brought to the Americas to become slaves. This was the beginning of a 250-year period in which African Americans were systematically oppressed through the system of slavery.
      <br><br>
      Slaves were forced to do manual labor by their White masters and were kept in this position by both laws and the misguided social norms of the time. Though the slave trade itself legally ended in 1808, illegal trade still continued. In addition, unlike past examples of slavery, the children of slaves were also born into slavery, allowing the slave population to grow on its own and keeping families in slavery indefinitely. Much more could certainly be said about the horros of slavery, but this oppressive system kept African Americans from accumulating any wealth whatsoever for centuries. 
      <br><br>
      The practice ended following the Civil War in 1865, but minorities' struggles were far from over.

    <h4>
      Sharecropping
    </h4>

    <p>
      Following the end of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/American-Civil-War">Civil War</a>, former slaves were in need of work. Many turned to sharecropping.
      <br><br>
      <b>What is sharecropping?</b>
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A system where the landlord allows a tenant to use the land in exchange for a share of the crop.</li>
        <li>The share owed to the landlord was large, leaving the tenants with little wealth and ensuring they would remain tied to the land.</li>
        <li>Laws favored landowners over the tenants.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Tenants could not sell to others besides their landlord.</li>
          <li>Indebted tenants could not move.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Sharecropping kept many former slaves in debt following the Civil War, preventing them from accumulating wealth for decades. In fact, its end was only brought about in the 1940s - <u>75 years after the Civil War</u> - by the Great Depression, new technologies, and migration.

    <h4>
      Jim Crow Laws
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      Jim Crow laws were a collection of state and local statutes that <u>legalized racial segregation</u>. They kept a stranglehold on African Americans from the end of the Civil War until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed to uphold the idea of white supremacy</li>
      <li>Suppressed African Americans' ability to vote, gain an education, become employed, and more</li>
    </ul>
    
    <center><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7aa02e_21e2c1a2e6844715babcdf0ef91317a5.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_565,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/7aa02e_21e2c1a2e6844715babcdf0ef91317a5.jpg" width="500" border="5px solid #555"/></center>
    <p>
      Jim Crow began with Black Codes in the South.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Served as a legal way to put African Americans into indentured servitude and restrict many aspects of their lives.</li>
      <li>Worked because the legal system - full of former Confederates - was stacked against African Americans.</li>
      <li>African Americans often served longer sentences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These "Black Codes" did not have as much of an impact in southern cities, and thus many African Americans moved to urban centers for greater freedom. However, this led white people in the cities to demand laws that restricting the rights of minorities. This was the origin of segregation, as everything from water fountains and bathrooms to schools, jails, bus stations, elevators, and cemetaries became segregated. All aspects of American life became separated on the basis of skin color. The North was not immune to Jim Crow either. Restrictions were put in place to limit African American voting and both schools and neighborhoods were segregated.
      <br><br>In 1896, the Supreme Court upheld legal segregation by a 7-1 majority in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Plessy-v-Ferguson-1896"><i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i></a>. In doing so, they created the idea of "separate but equal" - a misguided doctrine that would influence American society for decades to come.

    <h4>
      Federal Housing Policies
    </h4>

    <p>
      In the 1930s, the federal government passed a large number of laws as part of the New Deal, hoping to provide relief, reform, and recovery to a struggling America. In 1934, Congress passed the National Housing Act, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). However, the FHA instituted many discriminatory policies that furthered segregation and hurt African American communites economically.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Redlining:</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Puts services out of reach for residents of certain areas based on race or ethnicity.</li>
          <li>The government and lenders would literally draw a red line on a map around neighborhoods they would not invest in based solely on demographics.</li>
          <li>Black inner-city neighborhoods were most likely to be redlined.</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Blockbusting:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Used by real estate agents and developers throughout the mid-1900s.</li>
        <li>They persuaded owners to sell property cheaply because of the fear of people of another race or class moving into the neighborhood.</li>
        <li>Then, they would profit by reselling at a higher price.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Subsidies:</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The FHA subsidized builders who were mass-producing entire subdivisions for whites.</li> 
        <li>Only subsidized as long as none of the homes were sold to African-Americans.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Discriminatory housing practices were finally halted by the Fair Housing Act in 1968, but by that point, the damage had already been done. While the housing market flourished and white Americans saw great economic growth, minorities were unable to accumulate wealth.

      "The segregation of our metropolitan areas today leads ... to stagnant inequality, because families are much less able to be upwardly mobile when they're living in segregated neighborhoods where opportunity is absent." - Richard Rothstein, Author of <i>The Color of Law</i>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Solutions
    </h2>

    <p>
      The current political climate may not allow for the implementation of policies solely focused on minorities. Emily Badger, who writes about housing and inequality for the New York Times, notes that “prospects for race-based policies before the Supreme Court are unpromising, and that’s unlikely to change with five conservative justices,” and thus concludes that proponents of narrowing the wealth gap must instead create policies that disproportionately build wealth for minorities without singling them out.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Cost of Education
    </h4>

    <p>
      In total, forty-three million Americans have a combined total of nearly 1.3 trillion dollars in college debt. However, as Danielle Douglas-Gabriel, who covers the economics of education for the Washington Post, notes, “African Americans are more likely to have student debt, with fifty-four percent of African Americans between ages twenty-five and forty having student loans compared to thirty-nine percent of Whites”. 
      <br><br>Policymakers could reduce student debt for households making less than $50,000 per year. A study found that doing so could potentially lead to a thirty-seven percent reduction in the wealth gap between African American and White families, and would allow for a greater accumulation of wealth amongst young African Americans. A similar effect would likely be seen amongst other minority communities.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Minimum Wage
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      The current federal minimum wage is lower than the cost of living in every city in the United States, and African American workers are twice as likely as white workers to be part of the “working poor,” which means that their job does not pay enough to cover basic living expenses. This issue could be mitigated by raising the minimum wage to twelve dollars an hour. David Cooper, Senior Economic Analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, argues that “raising the minimum wage to $12... would directly or indirectly lift wages for 35.1 million workers.”
      <br><br>Such a change would disproportionately benefit minorities, given their increased poverty rates. Despite other claims, businesses benefit from this change as well. Employee morale, work ethic, and productivity all increase as a result of the physical and mental health benefits of a higher wage, while absenteeism for reasons other than illness has been found to decrease. Clearly, this benefits both the businesses and the workers. Another popular counterargument is that such a raise would kill jobs. However, John Schmitt, who serves as a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, found that increasing the minimum wage has “no discernible effect on employment” and thus, such a raise would not be economically detrimental.
